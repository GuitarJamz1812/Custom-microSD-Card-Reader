# Custom-microSD-Card-Reader
This repository contains all files for creating our very own microSD card reader. We desired a solution that was mechanically robust to ensure the microSD cards did not fall out in high vibration environments. We also desired to reduce the amount of space taken up by external microSD card readers. We can then re-use the template for future projects
